# React Todo List Project

![Github License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

### Welcome to my first project created with React!

I decided it was about time to strengthen my programming skills by diving deep into the Javascript library React, and what better way than to build my first Todo list! I also thought I'd use this project as an opportunity to sharpen my Javascript, code structure, and design skills.

The source of the code can also be found on my portfolio website:

### syntaxsamurai.com

while currently the app is in a basic functioning state, I can assure you that updates such as UI/UX design, JS functionality, will be implemented in iterations as soon as I can! I also fully intend on using this as an opportunity to learn about and incorporate the use of new tools and features.
